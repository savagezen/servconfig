### Asus X205TA Server Configs

These are the assorted settings and dotfiles for my minimalist [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) installation on an [Asus X205TA](https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/ASUS_EeeBook_X205TA/) netbook.  I specifically use the machine as a local server running primarily as an introductory device for [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net).  This machine has been [notoriously difficult to operate with linux](https://github.com/savagezen/x205ta) so I will try to include any udpated changes the guides I've previously created.
